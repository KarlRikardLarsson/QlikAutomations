🚨 The Classic Table in Qlik is Being Retired
Sometimes features we take for granted quietly step down — and the “classic table” in Qlik is one of them. 💼

According to this LinkedIn post by Michael Tarallo, it will be completely removed with 12 months' notice.

So now is a good time to start phasing out that old workhorse and make sure it’s no longer cluttering up your production apps — just in case nothing changes.

🛠️ Automation to Help You Audit Your Apps
I’ve created an automation that:

Scans all published apps in your Qlik Cloud environment

Identifies apps containing the old classic table (in published sheets)

Provides links to both the published app and its original (development) app

💡 Bonus Tip: Sheet IDs Stay the Same
Did you know sheets retain the same ID when you publish an app?
That means you can map a published sheet back to its original just by comparing the URLs! 🔗

Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
Published app:  .../sense/app/A1B2C3/sheet/XYZ123  
Original app:   .../sense/app/DEV456/sheet/XYZ123
⚠️ Heads-Up:
If you copy apps or create new sheets, the sheet ID changes.
This can break things like bookmarks that rely on the original sheet location.
